Bugs:
-----

Bug:	Harvesters block each other and then stop harvesting

Bug:	If you have a lot of units and send them out all together you can see some flickering.

Bug:	AI tries to place buildings outside the map if base is near map edge (see Harkonnen Level 16 (SCENH016.INI)).
(Fix:)	Until now this bug isn't really fixed but AI is prevented to build outside the map. It seems, that AI can handle this situation and tries somewhere else.


Todo:
-----

Multiplayer mode

Computer AI scripting with lua

Use the "tutorial" strings from Dune 2 for a short introduction of new buildings

Mentat help

Improve air units movement

A map editor written in QT, wxWidgets, etc.
(MapEditor.cpp is now depreciated!)



Ideas:
------

In Multiplayer games two gamers can control one house. The mousepointer of the other guy is shown in grey. Only one person can select a unit/building at a time.

A Tower-Defense mode. The computer sends units from one point on the map (source) to another point (sink, destination). The way between these to points is very complicated. The goal for the human players is to kill these units before they reach the sink. For every killed unit the player gets money. The player can only build towers.
Split-View: Two players can play on one computer like e.g. The Settlers II.

Touchscreen support, e.g. for smartphones

Various zoom levels. A ground tile is currently 16x16 pixels. Zoomfactors of x2, x3 or x4 would be very useful for high density displays (>100 dpi).
